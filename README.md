## Workflow Guide

Yet another edit history navigator extension for VsCode. Offers a command to go one step further back in edit history, defaults to KeyBinding ctrl+q. Any navigation or selection will reset the command to once again go to the latest edit. Any edits close to the last edit will be bundled into one edit history item, the closeness can be configured.

With create/toggle edit on current line command the current position is moved to the top of the bookmark/edit stack, making for quick back tracking. Config options can be set to automatically move current bookmark up to top of stack, for a stack back jumping workflow. Can also open up search pallet to view edit/mark history.

This extension is very opinionated, but I'm happy to take suggestions. Just open an issue or pull request on Github!

## Known Issues

- Cant save edit history in files that has not yet been saved to disk.
